An up counter is a sequential circuit that increments its count value with each clock pulse, moving from 0 up to its maximum before rolling over. A down counter works in the opposite way, decrementing the count value with each clock pulse, starting from the maximum and moving down to 0 before repeating. Both are widely used in digital systems for event counting, timing, and control applications.
